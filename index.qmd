## What I Do
Oluwafemi Oyedele is a research assistant at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) specializing in the cocoa soils project. I obtained  a Master's degree in Agrometeorology from the University of Ibadan with distinction. Oluwafemi's work involves studying soil properties, nutrient dynamics, and other factors that affect cocoa production in tropical regions. I have a strong interest in processed-based modeling, which focuses on simulating and predicting complex processes in natural systems.

I also have a keen interest in Bayesian statistics, a powerful statistical approach that uses prior knowledge and probabilities to refine inferences. Additionally, I contribute to the R4DS online learning community as a mentor, helping aspiring data scientists learn R and its applications in data science. Overall, Oluwafemi's expertise and interests demonstrate their commitment to employing advanced analytical techniques in their research and supporting the growth of data scientists.
