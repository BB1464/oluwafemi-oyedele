I obtained  a Master's degree in Agrometeorology from the University of Ibadan with distinction. Oluwafemi's work involves studying soil properties, nutrient dynamics, and other factors that affect cocoa and cassava production in tropical regions. I have a strong interest in processed-based modeling, which focuses on simulating and predicting complex processes in natural systems. \nI also have a keen interest in Bayesian statistics, a powerful statistical approach that uses prior knowledge and probabilities to refine inferences. Additionally, I contribute to the R4DS online learning community as a mentor, helping aspiring data scientists learn R and its applications in data science. Overall, Oluwafemi's expertise and interests demonstrate his commitment to employing advanced analytical techniques in his research and supporting the growth of data science. I am currently researching on assessing the resilience of cassava to climate change through process-oriented modelling approach for my PhD at the University of Kassel, Germany. On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, talks, and blogs. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking.
